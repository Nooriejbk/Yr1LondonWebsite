Personal Profile: I am a very dedicated person especially when it comes to the things I love to do, also when it comes to written and verbal instructions I am excellent at following, I have had a lot of experience in my Applied Science lessons when doing important class experiments. I tend to have a very punctual mindset where I would normally arrive really early.



Skills: During my last work experience it helped me to strengthen my communication skills and problem solving skills, due to the fact that I worked in a kindergarten where I communicated with the other adults in the room, also with the kids, it also helped me to develop my problem solving skills. I am a self-motivated person and with the right motivation I will be determined to reach my goals in life. One of the many skills that I have includes the fact that I speak more than one language (Somali and English), I would normally use this skill to translate for my mum at her appointments or when she’s going shopping and she needs me to speak to the retailer.

Work history:
<ol><b>Tara Kindergarten- Ponders end (Work Experience )                                  14th- 23rd July 2014</b>
Working at this placement was a huge opportunity for me to develop many of my skills, including communication skills, listening skills, problem solving. It helped as I communicated with the kids of a variety of ages, also during my time there, a fire bell rang causing me to start using my problem-solving skills and communication skills in order to take all the kids outside and make sure that they are all safe.</ol> 
<ol><b>Enfield Age UK- Edmonton Green (Work Experience)              8th August – 18th August 2016</b>
      In this environment I worked with more elderly people and I was able to strengthen my communication skills by starting conversations with them and help them when doing certain activities such as playing bingo and other board games. Since most of them had dementia I had to be able to converse with them when they believe I was someone that they are related to.</ol> 
<ol><b>Kinder-und Jugendmedizin- Germany (Work Experience)                    12th June- 7th July 2017</b>
Through this work experience I was able to experience working in a faster paced environment were the doctor was constantly changing rooms since I was shadowing the doctor. I was able to experience how it is that doctors work and the type of environment that they work in. I was able to see how it is that the doctor treated the children since she is a paediatrician.</ol> 
<ol><b>Best Tutors- Edmonton Green                                                      October 2017- Present</b>
In this part-time job I tutored Key- Stage 3 students who were mostly from the ages of 9- 14. Through this my communication and leadership skills have improved since I had to help the children whenever they needed help and if they were shy to be able to ask them how they are doing and if they need any help. </ol> 

<ol>Hobbies and Interests: During my free time I enjoy reading books a lot and sometimes even writing some of my own. There are also other times where I like to draw/paint and even go out with my friends to different places in London or even some medicine related events. </ol>
